# Knowledge Builder

**Version**: 0.1  
**License**: AGPLv3

## Overview

The Knowledge Map App is a progressive web application (PWA) that enables students to build and explore semantic knowledge maps. The core idea is to express knowledge through **relations between concepts**, which are visualized as propositions (e.g., "cell is a unit of living organisms").

Built with a **React frontend**, **D3.js for visualization**, and a **Flask + SQLite backend**, the app supports node creation, semantic relation types, and graph expansion in an intuitive and educationally meaningful interface.

## Features

- 🧠 **Add nodes** with optional AI-generated summaries
- 🔗 **Create semantic relations** between nodes using reusable relation types
- 📚 **Manage relation types** (e.g., symmetric, transitive, inverse name)
- 🌐 **Radial layout** using D3.js
- 🔍 **Searchable node list** with click-to-expand functionality
- 📜 **Proposition view** of relations (subject–predicate–object)
- 🗑 **Inline relation deletion**
- 🧰 Uses SQLite for lightweight data persistence
